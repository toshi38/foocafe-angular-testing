# Angular testing... but faster!

### Foreword
Thanks to everyone that came out to my talk at foocafe on November 15. It was a ton of fun!   Below you’ll find a PDF version of the slides.

If you’ve randomly stumbled on this repo, and haven’t seen the talk, feel free to ping me about having a talk!

### About the talk

For better or worse Angular comes with a very opinionated set of tools. Fortunately just like an opinionated partner you can kick them to the curb them and move on!

We’ll start by discussing how good tests look for an Angular front end.  What sort of tests we can write, and how those look with the default tooling. After trying out the Karma setup that ships in the Angular box we’ll discuss some drawbacks of this setup.

Once we’ve explored testing in Angular, we’ll then discuss leaving those tools for Jest.  We’ll discuss what Jest is, as well as our motivation for breaking from the norm.
